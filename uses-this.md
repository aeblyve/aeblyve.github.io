Tool use is everything and nothing. The most important thing is to get work done.

### i3 Window Manager
By [Michael Stapelberg](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/) et al.
Fast, uses screen space effectively. 
FOSS.

### Emacs Editor
By [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) et al.
Runs everywhere (GUI, TUI), highly extensible. 
Used with evil-mode. Org-mode for personal organization pretty extensively.
FOSS.

### NixOS Operating System
By [Eelco Dolstra](https://edolstra.github.io/) et al.
Declaratively and centrally configured Linux distribution.
Contrast with Ansible, which is more imperative-brained, vs functional.
Useful for re-using configuration between systems, rollback stability.
Comes also with general build system, "flakes", with a focus on purity and reproducibility.
Technically source-based but purity and reproducibility means binary distribution "caching" is widespread.
FOSS.

### `lf` File Manager
By [Gökçehan Kara](https://gokcehan.github.io/) et al.
Terminal-oriented, customizable, fast. 
FOSS.

### ActivityWatch Automatic Time Tracker
By [Erik Bjäreholt](https://erik.bjareholt.com/) et al.
Shows you what you do on the computer, without intervention on your part.
Plugins for browsers, editors. Some work on Android.
FOSS.

### Barrier IP KVM
I use this to switch between work and personal computers.
Cross-platform, although I only use it on NixOS.
FOSS.

### Requests

I'm currently on the lookout for something like Readwise Reader, although self-hosted.
Feel free to contact me if you know of something that fits the bill.
